# TODO

-   [ ] Move CSS back into one file (since it was a requirement)
-   [ ] The second paragraph of the first article element should be written in
        bold text, with a blue text color.
-   [ ] In the unordered list in the side content, items should appear in
        alternating colors (green and red, as a suggestion).
